- Uses `cmark`, a [C implementation][cmark] of [CommonMark], for parsing and
rendering. This is a lot of faster than other existing Ruby and JavaScript
solutions.
- Allows you to select your default editor and open the previewed document in it
by hitting `Cmd+e`, using the menu item, or clicking the toolbar button.
- Uses [highlight.js] for syntax highlighting.
- Detects YAML frontmatter and renders it as a special code block.
- Auto-reloads the preview whenever the original file is saved. Depending on
your editor, you might be able to set up auto-save to get an always up-to-date
preview without manually saving.
- Shows basic information such word and character count.
